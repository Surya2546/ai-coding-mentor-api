The program is enclosed in a function main() which is called when the program is run. In C, the entry point of an executable program is always the main() function."

Then, a `for` loop executes `num` number of times, with each iteration printing a hash symbol (`#`) using the `print()` function.\n\nYou can replace `num` with a number of your choice to print more or fewer hash symbols as required."
